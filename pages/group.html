                    <h4>What is group couching</h4>
                    <p>Group coaching, which can also be referred to as peer group coaching, 
                        brings together a group of employees for a specific purpose, or goal. 
                        For example, peer coaching groups may bring together new people leaders, 
                        a leadership peer group, or high-potentials.<br/><br/> Unlike training where content 
                        develops competency in a given topic through lectures or activities,
                         group coaching takes place in a collaborative environment. <br/><br/>
                          The coach facilitates discussions and runs structured activities for the peer group,
                           in order to bring different viewpoints, insights, and knowledge to light that ultimately encourage learning, growth,
                        and complex problem-solving. Ultimately, the goal of peer coaching groups is to help employees discover alternative viewpoints,
                        provides an opportunity to give and receive feedback, and builds relationships that are based on trust and a shared experience, which extends
                         long after the peer group coaching program or initiative concludes.</p>

                <div class="service-desc-textbox">
                    <h4>What are the benefits of group coaching?</h4>
                    <p>The benefits of group coaching include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provides an opportunity to work closely with others which may otherwise not exist</li>
                        <li>Expands one's professional network, encourages relationship building, and breaks down internal silos</li>
                        <li>Develops communication skills, such as delivering and receiving feedback, coaching others, active listening, and asking probing questions</li>
                        <li>Fosters reflection and greater self-awareness through discussion and feedback</li>
                        <li>Promotes idea diversity, collaboration among employees, and learning from others as peer group work together to find innovative solutions to complex problems</li>
                        <li>Increases problem-solving, planning, and teamwork skills</li>
                        <li>Builds deeper relationships and connections through a common experience</li>
                        <li>Increases sense of accountability as the peer group and lead coach will be soliciting updates on problems being tackled, new ideas implemented, and milestones achieved against desired goals</li>
                        <li>Drives a sense of purpose in the work each peer group coaching participants is doing within their department </li>
                        <li>Amplifies the likelihood of goal achievement for individuals, teams, and organization</li>
                        <li>Encourages independent continuous learning</li>

                <div class="service-desc-textbox">
                    <h4>is group coaching effective</h4>
                    <p>The effectiveness of group coaching will depend on what success looks like for your organization, the audience participating, and the reasons for initiating group coaching. As with any initiative, it’s best to establish expectations and desired outcomes upfront so you can measure success as the group coaching program proceeds. <br/><br/>
                        For example, in a study of 45 newly graduated doctors who participated in group coaching, it was effective as, "Participants" communication skills improved due to an increased awareness of other peoples’ perspectives and preferences. They realized the importance of good relations, saw how they could become active contributors 
                        in their departments, and began to practice leadership skills through e.g. involvement of the team, delegation of work, and negotiation of own obligations.”</p>

                    <h4>Conclusion: group coaching is effective</h4>
                    <p>From skill development to a boost in employee engagement, and increased collaboration there are many benefits for both individuals and organizations that invest in peer group coaching. In an article by Harvard Business Review, it was said that “there is a sense of camaraderie and good feeling that comes when you have a positive impact as a coach on another person’s well-being, and peer coaches learn things about themselves both through the act of coaching others and, of course, by receiving coaching themselves.” Peer group coaching may be just what your organization has been looking to take its employee development efforts to the next level.</p>
