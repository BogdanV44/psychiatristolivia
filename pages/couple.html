                    <h4>What Is Couples Therapy?</h4>
                    <p>Couples therapy is a form of psychotherapy that can help you and your partner improve your relationship. If you are having relationship difficulties, you can seek couples therapy to help rebuild your relationship. <br/><br/>

                        “Couples therapy can address a wide range of relationship issues, including recurring conflicts, feelings of disconnection, an affair, issues related to sex, or difficulties due to external stressors,” says Brian Mueller, PhD, a psychologist at Columbia University Medical Center who specializes in couples therapy. <br/><br/>
                        
                        Couples therapy can help you at any stage of your relationship, regardless of marital status, age, race, faith, or sexual orientation.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Some forms of this therapy include marriage counseling, premarital counseling, and family therapy. It is typically a short-term form of therapy.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-desc-textbox">
                    <h4>Techniques</h4>
                    <p>Couples therapists often employ an integrated approach to treatment, borrowing techniques from different forms of therapy, depending on your needs.<br/><br/>These are some of the strategies a couples therapist might employ:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Getting to know you:</span>“The therapist creates a sense of safety by getting to know you and your partner. They work actively and collaboratively with you to help you understand yourself and your partner better,”
                        says Olivia.</li>
                        <li><span>Identifying feelings:</span>“The therapist helps you and your partner identify feelings and put them into words to one another,” says Olivia.</li>
                        <li><span>Exploring the past:</span>Couples therapy can involve exploring your past, since that can help you better understand your fears, motivations, and behaviors in a relationship. It can also help address unresolved conflicts that affect your present.</li>
                        <li><span>Focusing on solutions:</span>Your therapist will work with you and your partner to resolve issues, correct negative behavior patterns, and focus on positive aspects of the relationship.</li>
                        <li><span>Teaching skills:</span>Couples therapy can help teach you and your partner anger management, problem solving, and conflict resolution skills. The aim is to equip you and your partner with tools to help you deal with issues as they crop up.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="service-desc-textbox">
                    <h4>What Couples Therapy Can Help With</h4>
                    <p>Couples therapy can give you and your partner the opportunity to discuss and resolve issues related to several aspects of your relationship, which can include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Roles in the relationship:</span> Couples therapy can help you examine the roles you and your partner play in the relationship and identify unhealthy dynamics. It can also help address differences in expectations.</li>
                        <li><span>Beliefs and values:</span> Couples therapy can help you and your partner discuss your beliefs, values, and religious sentiments and the implications of these aspects on your daily lives.</li>
                        <li><span>Finances:</span> Finances can be a major source of conflict in relationships. Couples therapy can help promote open dialogue and transparency around income and spending habits.</li>
                        <li><span>Time spent together:</span> You and your partner can address issues that have been sabotaging your time together. You can discuss activities that you enjoy doing together and how to make time spent together more enjoyable.</li>
                        <li><span>Children:</span> If you and your partner are not on the same page about whether or not you want to have children or how you would like to raise them, couples therapy can help you communicate these concerns. It can also help with stressors like difficulty conceiving or adopting children.</li>
                        <li><span>Familial relationships:</span> Couples therapy can help you and your partner work out issues stemming from conflicts with other family members, like parents, children, and siblings.</li>
                        <li><span>Sex and intimacy:</span> If you and your partner are having issues related to sex and intimacy, or infidelity, couples therapy can offer a safe space for you to share your feelings and needs.</li>
                        <li><span>External stressors:</span> Therapy can also help you and your partner deal with conflicts caused by external factors, like work for instance, that can put stress on your relationship.</li>
                        <li><span>Health issues:</span> Physical or mental health illnesses can be hard on you and your partner. Couples therapy can help you deal with the stress it puts on your relationship.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="service-desc-textbox">
                    <h4>How to Get Started</h4>
                    <p>If you feel your relationship would benefit from couples therapy, discuss it with your partner and see if they're open to it. If they're resistant to it, explain why it's important to you and how you think it might help your relationship.<br/><br/>

                        The next step is to find a practitioner. Couples therapy is often provided by licensed therapists known as marriage and family therapists; however, other psychologists and psychiatrists may offer it as well. Friends or family might be able to suggest someone you can go to, or if you're seeing a therapist for other reasons, they may be able to refer you to a specialist.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Check with your partner what days and timings work for them. Try to find a therapist who is conveniently located, if you and your partner prefer in-person sessions. Make sure the therapist takes your insurance plan. <br/><br/>
                        
                        When you start therapy, you and your partner will probably have to fill out forms detailing your medical history and insurance information. You may also have to fill out questionnaires to help your therapist better understand your relationship, the issues you're facing, and what you hope to gain from therapy.<br/><br/>
                        
                        Your therapist will work with you and your partner to outline the goals for therapy. While couples therapy typically involves joint sessions, your therapist may also do individual sessions with you or your partner. They may also assign homework.</p>
