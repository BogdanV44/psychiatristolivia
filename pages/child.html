                    <h4>Stages of development: Birth to teens</h4>
                    <p>Children go through changes in their moods and behaviors as they grow. Some of these changes are predictable.
                    They can be challenging, but most are normal parts of child development. When a child's behavior matches their age,
                    "growing pains" need not cause concern. <br/><br/>
                    Many theories address the phases of child development. 
                    Knowing these stages can help parents and caregivers understand child behavior and needs. 
                    Erik Erikson was an influential developmental psychologist. His theory outlines the stages of psychosocial development
                    from birth to adulthood. It is one of the most popular stage-based theories. 
                    Erikson identified eight stages of life. Five of these stages take place in childhood and adolescence: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Infancy: Trust vs. Mistrust.</span> In the first stage of human development, infants explore the world. They learn if their environment is safe and predictable. Infants need attention and comfort from their parents. It is from parents that they develop their first sense of trust or mistrust.</li>
                        <li><span>Early Childhood: Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt.</span>. Children start asserting independence. They develop preferences and start making choices. Defiance, tantrums, and stubbornness are common. Children begin developing interests. They also gain a sense of autonomy, shame, and doubt.</li>
                        <li><span>Preschool Years: Initiative vs. Guilt.</span> Children learn about social roles and emotions. They become active and curious. Imaginary play is crucial in this stage. Children continue to display their willpower as they grow. Parents' and caregivers' reactions will impact their child's behavior. They can affect a child's will to act on their own as well as their attitudes about misbehavior.</li>
                        <li><span>School Age: Industry (Competence) vs. Inferiority.</span> Relationships and schoolwork become more important in this stage. Children begin to show a wide and complex range of emotions. Problems in school or with friends may lead to mental health conditions such as depression or anxiety. Academic and social tasks become more demanding. Conditions such as attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) and oppositional behavior may interfere.</li>
                        <li><span>Adolescence: Identity vs. Role Confusion.</span> Adolescents, or teens, become more independent. They may form identities by trying out new behaviors and roles. Puberty usually occurs in this stage. It brings many physical and emotional changes. Changes during these years may strain parent-teen relationships. New behaviors may go beyond boundary-pushing and cause problems. Emotional highs and lows may persist. This could lead to anxiety or depression.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="service-desc-textbox">
                    <h4>Teens and relationship</h4>
                    <p>When children reach adolescence, relationships can cause strife.
                    Platonic and romantic relationships may cause this stress.
                    Relationships between parents and children are crucial to healthy development. 
                    But they may become strained by the changes that come with adolescence. For example, 
                    teenagers may worry about romantic relationships. Some teenagers become overly stressed by worrying about relationships. 
                    This may lead to mental health issues or a lower quality of life. <br/><br/> 
                    A poll reports 35% of teens have some experience with dating or relationships. Of this 35%, nearly one third reports being sexually active. Another study reports that a third of teens in relationships will experience abuse from their partner. Intimacy and dating abuse can increase risk of mental health issues, self-harm, and suicide.</p>

                <div class="service-desc-textbox">
                    <h4>Child and teen mental health risk factors</h4>
                    <p>Each phase of development brings specific challenges for children. They tend to work through 
                    these as normal a part of growing up. Mental health conditions can make these challenges harder. 
                    They may come up due to events in a child's life. These could have been traumatic events, such as being bullied.
                    They can also be routine, like moving to a new home.<br/><br/>
                    Every child responds differently to life changes. Some events that may impact a child or teen's mental health include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The birth of a sibling</li>
                        <li>The death of a loved one, such as a family member or a pet</li>
                        <li>Physical or sexual abuse</li>
                        <li>Poverty or homelessness</li>
                        <li>Natural disaster</li>
                        <li>Domestic violence</li>
                        <li>Moving to a new place or attending a new school</li>
                        <li>Being bullied</li>
                        <li>Taking on more responsibility than is age-appropriate</li>
                        <li>Parental divorce or separation</li>
                    </ul>
